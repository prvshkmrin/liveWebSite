# Portfolio â€” Enhanced Starter

This is a modernized version of your portfolio landing with:
- Responsive layout and accessible semantics
- Light/dark theme toggle with persistence
- Animated particle background (no heavy libs)
- Countdown badge (edit in `script.js`)
- Projects grid, skills tags, and a contact form
- Zero-build static: just HTML/CSS/JS

## Quick Start (GitHub Pages)
1. Replace links and content with your own.
2. If you want the form to work, create a free Formspree form and replace `your-id` in `index.html`.
3. Commit and push to the `main` branch.
4. Enable **Settings â†’ Pages â†’ Build from branch**.

Enjoy! ðŸŽ‰
